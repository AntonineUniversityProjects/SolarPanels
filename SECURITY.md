## What to do to stay safe


* Use Strong and Unique Passwords: Create strong passwords that are unique for each online account or system. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, and consider using a password manager to securely store and generate passwords.
   
* Be Cautious with Email and Phishing Attacks: Be vigilant about suspicious emails, attachments, and links. Avoid clicking on unknown or unexpected links, and never provide sensitive information or login credentials through email or on untrusted websites.

* Use Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software: Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software on your devices, and keep them up to date. Regularly scan your system for potential threats and remove any identified malware.

* Secure Your Home Network: Change default router passwords, enable encryption (such as WPA2 or WPA3) for your Wi-Fi network, and use a strong password. Regularly update your router's firmware to protect against known vulnerabilities.
